        <p>Example: With the world they know completely shrouded in darkness, monsters appeared and started decimating human populations. Forcing them underground.
            In order to survive the corruption within their ranks and dangers outside. Rose and her three
            friends must work together to discover the truth.
        </p>
        <p>The world as we know it is changing. The human realm, no longer human. No longer homogenous.
            With the collapse of the other realms and the genocide of the gods, those races have no where
            to go but to the human realm. We were told that the gods all agreed that killing themselves
            was the best thing for creation... but is that true? Is that the truth? With the joining of
            different races came multiple tensions and conflicts and the last remaining gods on the human
            realm made it so fighting was outlawed against other races. So what did humans do? We became 
            our own gods and made our own creations to wage for us.
