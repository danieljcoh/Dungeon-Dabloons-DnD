    <h1>Playthrough #1</h1>
    <p>The party made introductions in a Caravan after hearing about Sildar Hallwinters’ 
        request to help him find his daughter. Wagoning down to Phandalin to meet up with 
        Gundren Rockseeker, a friend of Sildar’s who supposedly took his granddaughter, 
        Austiria without explanation. Along the way, the party was ambushed by a militia of 
        Goblins. It was a harsh fight, but the party left victorious after an inexplicable 
        event happened as one of the goblins transformed into an unknown creature but inevitably 
        self-imploding. The events worked out for the party but caused two remaining goblins to 
        run away towards the mountains. The wagon suffered minimal damage but the bison that were 
        pulling the wagon escaped. The party collectively goes to gather the bison from the 
        surrounding area and as they do, they are stunned to see a luminous woman as if she is on 
        fire. They make contact, discovering their presence, the woman locks eyes, screams, and 
        ignites a huge fire while the surrounding area turns completely black and all that remain 
        are a pair of two menacing eyes in the sky. The woman disappeared, leaving a burned spot 
        on the ground, destroying a nearby garden of flowers. The party retrieves the Bison and 
        returns to the wagon. Sildar discovers the infamous goblin trail is nearby the wagon and 
        suggests everyone come along and follow it for their might be some clue as to what happened 
        with Gundren and Austuria. </p>
